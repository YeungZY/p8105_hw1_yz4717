First, we have to install the package.

```{r installpk,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("moderndive")
```

Then, I input the data which was mentioned in the problem.
```{r input}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```


```{r}
names(early_january_weather)
```
All names of vectors are shown above.

```{r}
shape_dat = c(
  row = nrow(early_january_weather),
  col = ncol(early_january_weather)
)
shape_dat
```
